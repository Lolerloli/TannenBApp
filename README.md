The EGJ Walldorf Christmas tree event collects all Christmas trees in Walldorf
and to coordinate this event better,
this Android App should provide a map, on wich the already done streets can be marked.
This should provide a better overview for all Teams, wich are helping in the event.

###TODOs:
* Basic conceptart and ideas
* Basic App features and needs
* Initialize Android projekt
* UI:
  * Basic Workflow concept
  * Basic Layouting
* Map:
  * Underlaying Picture or google Maps feed?
  * Draw on the Map
* Join new Event with QR Codes?
* Peer to Peer Communication?
* Blockchain for the Changes in the Map?
* Better name for the App than TannenBApp (Tannen Baum App) ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

###Suggestions:
* Accepted:
 * Paint Streets which have been done
 * Mark Christmas tree piles
 * Mark fetched Christmas tree piles
 * integrated Chat for communication (not sure yet)
* Rejected:
 * none
